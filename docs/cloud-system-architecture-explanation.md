## Architecture Overview

This architecture represents a modern, scalable cloud-based application designed for high availability, security, and performance. The system follows a microservices pattern with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers:

1. **External Entities Layer** - Users, administrators, and external services that interact with the system
2. **Presentation Layer** - Handles request distribution and content delivery
3. **Application Layer** - Core business logic implemented as microservices
4. **Data Layer** - Storage and processing of all data
5. **Infrastructure Layer** - Container orchestration and monitoring
6. **Security Layer** - Protection mechanisms across all components
7. **Deployment & Operations Layer** - Automation and infrastructure management
